# Phaedra: Serverless Ruby Functions

_NOTE: not yet released! Check back in June 2020!_

Phaedra is a web microframework for writing serverless Ruby functions. They are isolated pieces of logic which respond to HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and typically get mounted at a particular URL path. They can be tested locally and deployed to a supported serverless hosting platform or to any [Rack-compatible web server](https://github.com/rack/rack).

Serverless compatibility is presently focused on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), but there are likely additional platforms we'll be adding support for in the future (OpenFaaS, Fission, etc.).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "phaedra"
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install phaedra
```

## Usage

Functions are single Ruby files which respond to a URL path (aka `/api/path/to/function`). The path is determined by the location of the file on the filesystem relative to the functions root (aka `api`). So, given a path of `./api/folder/run-me.rb`, the URL path would be `/api/folder/run-me`.

Functions are written as subclasses of `Phaedra::Base` using the name `PhaedraFunction`. The `params` argument is a Hash containing the parsed contents of the incoming query string, form data, or body JSON. The response object returned by your function is typically a Hash which will be transformed into JSON output automatically, but it can also be plain text.

Some platforms require the function class name to be `Handler`, so you can put that at the bottom of your file for full compatibility.

Here's a basic example:

```ruby
require "phaedra"

class PhaedraFunction < Phaedra::Base
  def get(params)
    {
      text: "I am a response!",
      equals: params[:left].to_i + params[:right].to_i
    }
  end
end

Handler = PhaedraFunction
```

Your function can support `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete` methods which map to the corresponding HTTP verbs.

Each method is provided access to `request` and `response` objects. If your function was directly instantiated by WEBrick, those will be `WEBrick::HTTPRequest` and `WEBrick::HTTPResponse` respectively. If your function was instantiated by Rack, those will be `Phaedra::Request` (a thin wrapper around `Rack::Request`) and `Rack::Response` respectively.

## Callbacks

Functions can define `action` callbacks:

```ruby
class PhaedraFunction < Phaedra::Base
  before_action :do_stuff_before
  after_action :do_stuff_after
  around_action :do_it_all_around

  def do_stuff_before
    # code
  end

  # do_stuff_after, etc.

  def get(params)
    # this will be run within the callback chain
  end
end
```

You can modify the `request` object in a `before_action` callback to perform setup tasks before the actions are executed, or you can modify `response` in a `after_action` to further process the response.

## Rack

Booting Phaedra up as Rack app is very simple. All you need is a `config.ru` file alongside your `api` folder:

```ruby
require "phaedra"

run Phaedra::RackApp.new
```

Then run `rackup` in the terminal.

## WEBrick

Integrating Phaedra into a WEBrick server is pretty straightforward. Given a `server` object, it can be accomplished thusly:

```ruby
full_api_path = File.expand_path("api", Dir.pwd)
base_api_folder = File.basename(full_api_path)

server.mount_proc "/#{base_api_folder}" do |req, res|
  api_folder = File.dirname(req.path).sub("/#{base_api_folder}", "")
  endpoint = File.basename(req.path)
  ruby_path = File.join(full_api_path, api_folder, "#{endpoint}.rb")

  if File.exist?(ruby_path)
    original_verbosity = $VERBOSE
    $VERBOSE = nil
    load ruby_path
    $VERBOSE = original_verbosity

    handler = Handler.new(server)
    handler.service(req, res)
  else
    raise HTTPStatus::NotFound, "`#{req.path}' not found."
  end
end
```

You also have the option of loading and mounting `Handler` directly to the server:

```ruby
load File.join(Dir.pwd, "api", "func.rb")
@server.mount '/path', Handler
```

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
